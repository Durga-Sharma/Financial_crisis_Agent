## Problem
Financial crises destroy $4-5 trillion annually. Early signals exist 2-4 weeks before crashes but are invisible. Current solutions fail: nonexistent (retail), too expensive ($50K/month), or unexplainable black boxes (regulatory rejection).

## Solution
Multi-agent AI with transparent reasoning:
- Crisis Detector: Pattern recognition
- Risk Scorer: Quantification  
- Explainer: Communication

Why multi-agent? Single agent = generalist = mediocre. Three specialists = optimized = superior.

## Implementation
- Google ADK + Gemini 2.0 Flash
- Real data: Yahoo Finance + NewsAPI
- Deployed: Streamlit Cloud (live)
- Tested: 8 cases, 100% pass rate, < 5s response

## Impact
Retail: Early warning system  
Professionals: Fast, explainable analysis  
Enterprises: Regulatory-compliant AI

## Results
First accessible, deployed, explainable crisis detection system.

Market opportunity: $1B+ annually.
